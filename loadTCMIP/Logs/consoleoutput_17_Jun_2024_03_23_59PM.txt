(Client Status should be updated in the filed as per the eligibility).  If the member benefit plan ends with retro end date the extract should update the client status to be inactive (04) on the day following  end date being received.   EX: If we receive a retro date for the DOD(02/28/2024) on 04/01/2024 we should trigger an extract to SanData on the following day which is 04/02/2024.
Expected Results                   : Validat the ClientStatus which is always 2 digit. If the member has the active eligibility the client status should be 02 and inactive eligibility elibibility the client status should be 04.   Validate for retro and future dates.

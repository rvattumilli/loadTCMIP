Requirement RTM                       : 74
Requirement Narrative                 : Improve the way Primary providers are able to search for, and select, specific PID/Sls in the Manage Subordinates panel. This is needed because some users have thousands of PID/SLs. Prior discussion with UI team leader said that cannot have a "dynamic" search capability that when typing in some characters would automatically present a filtered list that would continue to filter displayed list as more characters are entered. But UI team leader said could add separate fields to accept partial search text for both PID/SL ID and PID/SL name.

But the request should be acted on by POSC immediately after requested. Based on modern technology experiences with many websites, the response that the report is ready to be downloaded should be with just a few minutes. If this seems technically hard to do that fast, ideally the requesting Primary provider can navigate to a different panel and be able to come back somewhere to retrieve the report once it is complete.

Don"t want to build a table of reason codes for failure, but if any explanation for a failure were able to provided without much effort, that would be helpful.

Requirement Narrative                 : Since iWI 37069, the definition of who is a Primary provider user for a PID/SL is that the user"s PID/SL has an in-effect security role of type 507 (Primary User & Secondary User). In-effect means that the date of the request - trunc(SYSDATE) - is greater than or equal to the effective date of the PID/SL role and that the end date is after trunc(SYSDATE.) It is preferable that this official definition is used rather than using the T_ANALYST_PROVIDERS parameter column indicating that the user/PIDSL is a Primary user, because there are no dates associated with T_ANALYST_PROVIDERS and we have some work to do still to clean up the data for users who have the mentioned-parameter and not the mentioned role.

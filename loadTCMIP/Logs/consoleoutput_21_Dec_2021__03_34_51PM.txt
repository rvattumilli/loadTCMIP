NOTE: If the DP were to be applied after the cycle the aid cat end date is picked up, no additional 834 displaying the DP would be sent. 
ICO Deemed mailing requirement on the plans will be handled in a different CO. 
After weekly cycle, it remains as above 
 
2) End of month 1 from the date eligibility ended:

NOTE: E2 letter is triggered when the member is assigned to a new MCO/ACOA (MSTD/MFAS/MSTDA/MFASA) plans or changes to a different MCO/ACOA.  This could be voluntary or system assigned and it could be due to a new assignment or a PCC or MCO/ACOA conversion. Business has also requested that  EA, E8 & E2  be merged into 1 template. EA is triggered when the member is assigned  to new ACOB/PCCB/CPCCB plan & E8 is triggered when the member is assigned to CAREPLUS ACOA/MCO (CRPLA/CRPLS) plans. This change will require an update to the E2 trigger logic which will be handled by WI 38656.
